# 🤡 Swiggy-Bank Clown: A Fun E-Commerce & Payment Simulation

Welcome to the **Swiggy-Bank Clown** project — a playful, interactive web application that simulates an e-commerce food ordering platform (Swiggy Clown) and a banking interface (Bank Clown) using only **Java**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

This project demonstrates full-stack logic using front-end technologies and Java-based backend simulation, showcasing cart functionality, fake payment processing, and balance tracking — all with a clownish twist! 🎪
